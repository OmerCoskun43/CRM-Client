    The application features a user-friendly interface designed with <strong>Tailwind CSS</strong>, allowing for responsive design and a modern look. Users can easily navigate through various sections, including customer management, product catalogs, sales tracking, and task organization.

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">
    The state management is handled by <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong>, which simplifies the process of managing application state. This ensures that data is consistently updated across the application and provides a smooth experience for users. Additionally, <strong>Redux Persist</strong> is used to maintain user sessions, allowing for data retention even after refreshing the page.
</p>

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">
    For routing, <strong>React Router DOM</strong> is implemented, enabling dynamic navigation between different pages of the application without reloading the entire app. This improves performance and provides a better user experience.

    The application also incorporates <strong>Axios</strong> for making HTTP requests to the backend, ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates. To enhance user feedback, <strong>HotToast</strong> is utilized for displaying notifications throughout the app.

<p style="font-size: 1.1em; line-height: 1.5;">
    Finally, data visualization is made easy with <strong>Recharts.js</strong>, allowing users to view and analyze data through interactive charts and graphs. This feature is essential for tracking performance metrics and gaining insights into customer behavior.
